#### Overview:

This assignment is designed for undergraduate students enrolled in the course "Embedded Systems for Mechatronics". It aims to deepen students' understanding of the fundamental components of embedded systems, specifically focusing on microcontrollers and microprocessors. Students are expected to explore the characteristics, functionalities, applications, and differences between microcontrollers, microprocessors, and embedded systems as a whole.

#### Objectives:

- To identify and describe the fundamental features of microcontrollers and microprocessors.
- To understand the role and application of embedded systems in mechatronics.
- To analyze the differences and similarities between microcontrollers and microprocessors within the context of embedded systems.
- To evaluate the selection criteria for using microcontrollers vs. microprocessors in specific mechatronic applications.

#### Assignment Task:

Write a comprehensive report that includes the following sections:

1. *Introduction:*
   - Briefly define microcontrollers, microprocessors, and embedded systems.
   - Outline the importance of these components in mechatronics.

2. *Microcontrollers:*
   - Describe the architecture and key features of microcontrollers.
   - Discuss typical applications of microcontrollers in mechatronics, providing specific examples.

3. *Microprocessors:*
   - Explain the architecture and key features of microprocessors.
   - Discuss typical applications of microprocessors in mechatronics, providing specific examples.
   - Highlight the advantages and limitations of using microprocessors in embedded systems.

4. *Comparison between Microcontrollers and Microprocessors:*
   - Compare and contrast the technical specifications (processing power, memory, peripherals, cost, etc.) of microcontrollers and microprocessors.
   - Discuss how the choice between a microcontroller and a microprocessor affects the design and functionality of an embedded system in mechatronics.

5. *Case Studies:*
   - Present two case studies of mechatronic systems: one that utilizes a microcontroller and another that uses a microprocessor. Analyze the rationale behind the selection of each component in these systems.

6. *Conclusion:*
   - Summarize the key differences and similarities between microcontrollers and microprocessors.
   - Reflect on the significance of these components in the development of efficient and effective embedded systems in mechatronics.

7. *References:*
